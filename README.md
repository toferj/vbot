# vbot
A Discord bot for my guild in the Legendary Game of Heroes 

This is the first Discord bot I've written. It's just a fun thing for my guild in a game.

If you happen to stumble upon this and want to use the code just note that there needs to be a `token.dat` file
at theroot of the project. This file needs to contain the bot token you generated on Discord's developer site.
